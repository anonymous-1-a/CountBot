## Use Cases

CountBot combines built-in tools and skill plugins to handle a variety of daily tasks:

### Information Retrieval & Search

"Search for today's AI news"
- Uses Baidu Search skill to fetch and summarize the latest information

"Find Western restaurants in Dongguan, I plan to leave at 6 PM"
- Calls Amap (Gaode) skill to search restaurants and plan routes

"What's the weather like today?"
- Queries the weather skill for real-time and forecast data

### Email & File Management

"Check if I have any new emails today"
- Connects to QQ/163 mailbox via email skill, auto-checks new mail

"Compress the images on my desktop and send them to my email"
- Uses file tools to package files, sends via email skill

### Image Processing & Creation

"Generate a picture of a cat celebrating New Year and send it to me"
- Calls image generation skill for AI art, delivers via channel

"Take a screenshot of my computer and send it to me"
- Uses screenshot tool to capture screen, sends via Lark/DingTalk

"What's in this image?"
- Image analysis skill identifies content with detailed descriptions

### Web Design & Publishing

"Design a personal resume webpage and publish it online"
- Uses web design skill to generate HTML, auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages

### Browser Automation

"Open Bing in the browser, search for AI, open the third result, then screenshot it for me"
- Browser automation skill handles complex web operation workflows

### Scheduled Tasks

"Check the weather for me every morning at 8 AM"
- Sets up a Cron task that auto-executes and pushes results

### Multi-Channel Collaboration

CountBot runs simultaneously on Web, Lark, DingTalk, QQ, and more. All channels share the same smart memory system — no matter where you chat, the AI remembers your preferences and history.

---

## Core Features

### Smart Memory System

CountBot's memory system includes:

- **Auto Conversation Summary** — LLM decides when to summarize, extracting key information
- **Rolling Context Compression** — Auto-compresses when conversation exceeds window, no info lost
- **Keyword Search** — Fast retrieval of historical memories by keyword
- **Line-Based Storage** — Simple, reliable file storage, easy to backup and migrate

```python
# Memory system works automatically
User: "My name is John, I live in Beijing"
AI: "Got it, I'll remember that"

# Days later...
User: "Where do I live again?"
AI: "You live in Beijing"  # Auto-retrieved from memory
```

### Heartbeat Proactive Greeting

CountBot has **proactive care capabilities**:

- **Smart Idle Detection** — Monitors user's last active time
- **Do Not Disturb** — Supports DND time windows (e.g., 22:00–08:00 Beijing time)
- **Daily Limit** — Prevents over-disturbance (default: max 2 per day)
- **Natural Randomness** — Not mechanical timed greetings, but natural care

```python
# User inactive for 4 hours, within active hours
AI: "Long time no see! What have you been up to? Need any help?"
```

### Zero-Config Security Model

An innovative **progressive security** design:

- **Local Access (127.0.0.1)** → Zero friction, direct use
- **Remote Access (192.168.x.x)** → Guided password setup on first visit
- **Password Requirements** → Min 8 chars, upper/lowercase + digits
- **Session Management** → 24-hour validity

```bash
# Local use — no configuration needed
http://localhost:8000  ✅ Direct access

# Remote use — auto-protected
http://192.168.1.100:8000  🔐 First-time password setup
```

### Personalization

In the Settings page under "User Management", you can configure:

12 Personality Presets

CountBot offers 12 distinct personality settings: Hot-Tempered Bro, Roast Master, Gentle Sister, Straight Shooter, Sharp-Tongued Boss, Chatterbox, Philosopher, Soft & Cute Assistant, Comedian, Energetic, Chuunibyou, Zen Master. You can also fully customize the personality description to match your usage habits.

Custom Nicknames & Location

- AI Name — Give your assistant a name (default: CountBot)
- User Nickname — How the AI addresses you
- User Location — Your location info (e.g., Dongguan), used for weather, maps, trip planning

### Precision On-Demand Cron Scheduler

Not polling, not a simple timer, but a **smart scheduling system**:

- **Precision Wake** — Calculates next task time, accurate to the second
- **Concurrency Control** — Semaphore-based max concurrency
- **Timeout Protection** — Max execution time per task (default: 300s)
- **Independent Sessions** — Each task uses its own database session
- **SQLite Lock Retry** — Auto-handles concurrent write conflicts

```python
# Not polling every second, but precisely calculating next wake time
next_wake = min([job.next_run for job in enabled_jobs])
await asyncio.sleep((next_wake - now).total_seconds())
```

---
